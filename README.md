## Ideas

* Enemies could evolve and swap characteristics in different life stages
* That implies that enemies could "eat"

* You have a life - inventory size
* Passive abilities (take slots of life)
 * Move - move - dash
 * Frame rate drop / world ticks faster
 * Double tap
 * Tripple tap
* Shrines where you can donate ability to next generation of you
* Some objects are blocking but movables and these objects may resolve conflicts of being moved. E.g. if you push a stone into a wall where wall means water the wall becomes normal ground
