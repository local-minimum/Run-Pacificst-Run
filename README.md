Do position of enemy not at 0, 0
Do level move monsters

## Ideas

* Enemies could evolve and swap characteristics in different life stages
* That implies that enemies could eat

* You have a life - inventory size
* Passive abilities (take slots of life)
 * Move - move - dash
 * Frame rate drop / world ticks faster
 * Double tap
 * Tripple tap
* Shrines where you can donate ability to next generation of you
